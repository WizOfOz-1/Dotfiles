# Dotfiles for my Arch Linux:

## Dependencies:
    - Sway
    - Foot Terminal
    - Firefox 
    - jt
    - Neovim

### Changes:
Now includes almost everything from mini.nvim, Just has the snippets and autocomplete aspects left cause nvim-cmp is wayy better still.

# TODO:
- Wait for mini.snippets
